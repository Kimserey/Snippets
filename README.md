Snippets
========

Almost everyday, I make small snippets of code to test things that I am learning and discovering... End up I keep losing all of this snippets and after a month or two, I have problem searching for the specific examples I built previously! From now on I will push all my small snippets here, hopefully this will help as well some people as well.
Those are all the snippets of code I have been using.
If you have any comments or you see any error in it, please leave me a message! 
Anyway thanks for looking at my stuff!
